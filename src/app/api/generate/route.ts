2. Stand so tall that they can't look past you. Intoxicate with your presence. Be notorious. Remain on people's minds. Flow so freely that they'll be scared of drowning in your thoughts. Don't be taken lightly. Be sure of yourself. Be irreplaceable. Move so fast that no one can see where you're going. Give them something to chase, but never let them catch up with you. Be more than what they bargained for. Make them hate you for being so fucking good. Burn so brightly that you catch the whole world on fire.

3. You can either stay wrapped in a blanket, scrolling reels, wasting time.

or sit at your desk, put in the work, and build something extraordinary.

The choice is yours, but donâ€™t cry when life hands you what you settle for.

Burn brightly or stay invisible.
